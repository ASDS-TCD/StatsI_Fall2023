		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
	
From the result tables, we can see that a slope coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$ for \textit{m2res\_i} (Table 4) and $\hat{\beta}_1$ for \textit{Presvote}  over \textit{Voteshare }(\textit{Difflog} controlled for)(Table 5) are identical = 0.257.

In Model 4, our outcome variable is \textit{Model 1 Residuals} that tells us how much of the variation in \textit{Voteshare} is \textbf{not }explained by \textit{Difflog } and our explanatory variable is \textit{Model 2 Residuals} that tells us how much of the variation in \textit{Presvote} is \textbf{not }explained by Difflog. 

Multiple linear regression analysis allows us to estimate the association between an outcome variable and an explanatory variable \textbf{holding all other variables constant. } In Model 5, we run a multivariate regression of \textit{Voteshare} over both \textit{Presvote} and \textit{Difflog}. Therefore, $\hat{\beta}_1$ for \textit{Presvote}  (\textit{Difflog} controlled for) represents the variance for  \textit{Voteshare} explained by \textit{Presvote} and \textbf{not} explained by \textit{Difflog}  -- similarly to Model 4.

We can also see that the Residual Standard Errors of both models = 0.073, so let's also check whether  the residuals of these two models are identical (as they should be):
